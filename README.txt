1. The file structure required for submission is under the "File Structure" folder. Please
note that all fields are in 1 file called the 'Audit File'. Under this Audit File, there
is a Header, MasterFiles and GeneralLedgerEntries sub-structures. Please see their respective PDF to see 
how these sub-structures under the Audit File umbrella are formed. We believe that the dotted 
lines are optional fields while solid lines are required fields (To be confirmed). For further information 
about the required and optional fields, please view the "Technical Documents" folder. In 
the file named "norwegian-saf-t-financial-data---technical-description", the fields are
listed as Mandatory (M) or optional (O). For example, on page 13, under the MasterFiles structure,
we see the GeneralLedgerAccounts sub-structure. Here, we see that AccountID and AccountDescription
are Mandatory (M) while StardardAccountID and GroupingCategory are Optional(O).

2.
Within the "Example Files" folder, there are 2 example XML files that implement the structure
discussed in the "File Structure" folder documents. There is also an XLS for testing and 
education purposes and does not represent the legal demands of the SAF-T Financial format".
